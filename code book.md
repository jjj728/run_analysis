Description
-----------
The dataset contains 88 columns and 180 rows. The 1st column contains the activity information. the 2nd column contains 
the subject information. Column 3~88 contain the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. Since there 
are 6 activities and 30 subjects, we have 6*30 = 180 rows in total.

Variable explanation
--------------------

1. Six activity names are in the 1st column: walking, walking_upstairs, walking_downstairs, sitting, standing, laying.

2. 30 subjects are in the 2nd column, they are labelled with different values (1~30).

3. In column 3~88, the variable names have multiple components. 
   (1) The first component is "t" or "f". "t" means time domain signal and "f" means frequency domain signals.
   (2) The second componnent is "Body" or "Gravity". "Body" means body singals and "GravityAcc" means gravity singals. 
   (3) The third component is "Acc" or "Gyro". "Acc" means accelerometer 3-axial raw signals and "Gyro" means gyroscope 
       3-axial raw signals.
   (4) The fourth component is "Jerk" or "Mag" (may not exist). "Jerk" means Jerk singals and "Mag" means the magnitude 
       of these three-dimensional signals calculated using the Euclidean norm.
   (5) The fifth component is "-mean" or "-std". "-mean" means the mean value of the measurement and "-std" means the 
       standard deviations of the measurement.
   (6) The sixth component is "-X", "-Y" or "-Z". They characterize the singals on different axis.

Examples
--------

1. A column named "tGravityAcc-std()-Y" contains standard deviations of the time domain gravity acceleration singals 
   on Y-axis.

2. A column named "fBodyGyro-mean()-Z " contains mean values of the frequency domain body gyroscope 3-axial raw singals 
   on Z-axis.
